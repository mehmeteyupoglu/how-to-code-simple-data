# Space Invaders 

## Questions/Clarifications

- ~~if we have the list in front of a list of invaders, are we making it a double list. ~~

```scheme
(check-expect (next-invaders (list I1)) ;; I1 is already a list
```

- update next-invaders and next-missiles functions with two input formats, e.g.

```scheme
(next-invaders lom loi)
```
